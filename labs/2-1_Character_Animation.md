This lab covers creating sprite animations in Piskel and adding them into a Godot Animated Sprite.  We'll be applying this to the player character in a game, but it is the same process for any animation in Godot.

## 1. Create Sprite Animations in Piskel
- Design animations for the basic character states:
	- Idle
	- Walk
	- Jump
	- Dies / Game Over
	- Hit (hit by enemy or obstacle)
	- Talk (optional)
	- Attack (optional)

## 2. Export Sprite Sheets
- Export using the Piskel SpriteSheet feature
- Import to Godot

## 3. Adding new Animations
- Download the [Assets_MMP270](./Assets_MMP270.zip) folder
- Use a previous project and add the assets or download the [Blank Template](./Blank_Template_MMP270.zip) folder  and add in necessary assets
- We need the Player scene, 2-1_Character_Animation scene, TileSets, PlayerController.gd and SceneSimple.gd scripts
- Use the AnimatedSprite node in Player scene
- Name animations, make sure they match the code

## 4. Document with screen shots or video
