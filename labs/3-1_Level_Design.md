Create a level in Godot using concepts from the [Level Design](../notes/level) lecture.

## 1. Setup Godot project
- Use your game project or download the [Default Project Template](./270_BlankTemplate.zip)
- Download the [Assets](./270_Assets.zip) folder if needed
- Duplicate the `UIScene.tscn` and rename the copy `Level1.tscn`

## 2. Designing the level
- Create a level using some of the basic principles and techniques discussed in the level design lectures (you don't need to use all of them)
- Use TileMaps for platforms, items and obstacles to build out the level
- Principles
	- Guidance
	- Obstacles and rewards
	- Perfect player principle
	- Pacing
- Techniques
	- Signposting
	- Foreshadowing
	- Gating
	- Risk vs reward
	- Safe zone
	- Branching
	- Bottle necking
	- Layering

## 3. Documenation
- Use screen shots or a video to document a playthrough of the level
- Explain how you used the principles and techniques
