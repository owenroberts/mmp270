This lab covers creating the art for User Interface Elements like titles and buttons using Piskel.

## 1. Design UI Elements in Piskel
- Design states for a button, including Idle, Hover and Active
- Design titles for the menu, instructions, game over and win game scenes

## 2. Export images as Zip file
- In most cases, UI elements in Godot do not use sprite sheets, so we need to export each frame separately as a PNG
- Piskel makes this easy with the export Zip option

## 3. Documentation
- Post the UI images on Open Lab
