Add a second level to the Godot project.  This approach would also apply to any subsequent levels added.

## 1. Setup Godot project
- Use an existing project or download the [Designer Default](./Designer_Default.zip)
- Duplicate the `UIScene.tscn` or your `Level1.tscn` and rename the copy `Level2.tscn`

## 2. Designing the level
- Designing a second level involves using the same principles and techniques, but we want to make this level unique, it should stand out visually and in the game play
- When duplicating `Level1` ideally your basic setup won't change, but if you make changes, such as adding to `Metrics` you can use the *Merge From Scene* function to update
- It could be more difficult, introduce new mechanics or layer mechanics together
- Use TileMaps for platforms, items and obstacles to build out the level
- Look at [Level Design](./3-1_Level_Design) to review principles and techniques

## 3. Documenation
- Use screen shots or a video to document a playthrough of the level
- Explain how this level is different than the previous level design
