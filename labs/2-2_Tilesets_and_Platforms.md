This lab covers designing platforms to be used in a platformer style game.  The same process can be used for obstacles/walls in a RPG style game.  We'll create the platforms in Piskel which can be implemented with a TileMap in Godot to make collisions with the player and other moving objects.

## 1. Design Tilesets
- Using Piskel or another art editor, create a set of repeatable tiles
- Tilesets can be used for platforms or basic scenery
- Choose a size: 32x32 or 64x64 are good starting points
- First we'll make platforms for single tiles and one for a simple auto tile demonstration

## 2. Export sprite sheets
- Export tiles as a sprite sheet

## 3. Documentation 
- Post sprite sheets on Godot
