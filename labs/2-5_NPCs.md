This lab demonstrates creating animations for an NPC and character faces for dialog scenes.

This lab goes along with the [Dialog Systems and Add-Ons](./1-7_Dialog_Systems_and_Add-Ons) programming lab.

## 1. Setup
- Create a folder for NPC art
- Open Piskel or another graphics application

## 2. NPC World Animations
- Design and create a character for the NPC
- It should be similar size and design as the player character
- Make animations for the `Idle` and `Talk` states
- Export sprite sheets for each animation

## 3. NPC Dialog Character Portraits
- Create a larger copy of the NPC art to make the dialog animations
- Make at least 3 expression for the NPC to show during dialog
- Focus on the head or make a full body image
- Export a zip of the invidividual frames

## 4. Optional: Add dialog images for player character
- Repeat the same process for the player character

## 5. Optional: Make an arrow to advance dialog
- We're using a Godot Add-On called Dialogic which has a built in arrow to advance the dialog tree
- Create your own arrow graphic to match your art/UI style

## 6. Documentation 
- Post sprite sheets and images on Open Lab
