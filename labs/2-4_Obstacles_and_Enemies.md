Create graphics and animations for obstacles and enemies.

## 1. Design an obstacle
- Start by designing a single obstacle
- This can be a static drawing, animation, or series of drawings
- Save sprite sheets to use in Godot

## 2. Design an animated enemy
- Enemies are similar to obstacles but they can move and take on different behaviors
- Design an enemy and create animations for Idle, Walking, Attacking and Dying states
- Save sprite sheets to use in Godot

## 3. Add art to Godot
- Use your game project or download the [Default Project Template](./270_BlankTemplate.zip)
- Download the [Assets](./270_Assets.zip) folder if you need to add the ObstacleSimple/ObstacleMoving scene to your project
- For extra Obstacles, duplicate either scene depending on the obstacle behavior

## 4. Documentation 
- Post sprite sheets on Open Lab
