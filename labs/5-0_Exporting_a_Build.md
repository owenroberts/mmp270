## 1. Setup
- Open your Godot game
- You may need to add scenes or assets from other projects
- For adding scenes across projects, copy and paste the scene file and all of the assets required (Sprites, TileSets, Audio, Scripts, Fonts etc)
- Open the scene and replace or ignore missing references
- Within a project, use the *Merge From Scene* function to add components to other scenes

## 2. Choose a build
- Start with a web build, this will be the easiest to play because users can play it directly in the browser
- You can also build for Mac, Windows or Linux
