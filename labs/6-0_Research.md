This lab covers doing and posting research.  The same steps apply to any reading, game or viewing.

## 1. Read, play or view the linked resource
- Seriously, read the whole thing, from the beginning to the end, it's probably not that long

## 2. Document three ideas, excerpts or moments 
- Choose three things from the resource that you think would be useful for other students to know
- For example, the first reading, "What is a Game?" by Chris Crawford, begins by defining the concept of a game.  What about the definition did you find interesting or surprising?
- Document each thing with a screen shot, video recording or quotatation
- Explain in 2-3 sentences why you think it is worth presenting

## 3. Post on the Open Lab
- Write a post on the Open Lab, in the Research category, with your documentation
- Present your post in the next class period
