This lab covers creating graphics for rewards in the game, like items to collect and a player life.

This lab is good to pair with [Collecting_Items](1-2_Collecting_Items).

## 1. Design rewards
- Using Piskel or another art editor, design the rewards for your game
- Create animations for two states, Idle and Collected
- Export sprite sheets to use in Godot

## 2. Add art to Godot
- Using the [Artist Default](./Artist_Default.zip) or your own game, add your animations into the pre-built `Item.tscn` and/or `Life.tscn` scene
- Download the [Assets](./Assets.zip) folder if you need to add the Item/Life scene to your project
- For extra Items, duplicate the Item scene

## 3. Documentation
- Post sprite sheets on Open Lab
