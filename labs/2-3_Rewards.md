Create graphics for rewards in the game, like items to collect and a player life.

This lab is good to pair with [Collecting Items](1-2_Collecting_Items).

## 1. Design rewards
- Using Piskel or another art editor, design the rewards for your game
- Create animations for two states, Idle and Collected
- Export sprite sheets to use in Godot

## 2. Add art to Godot
- Use your game project or download the [Default Project Template](./270_BlankTemplate.zip)
- Download the [Assets](./270_Assets.zip) folder if you need to add the Item/Life scene to your project
- For extra Items, duplicate the Item scene

## 3. Documentation
- Post sprite sheets on Open Lab
