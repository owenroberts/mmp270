## 1. Setup
- Download the [Designer Default](./Designer_Default.zip) or use your own project
- For artwork, you will need the rewards such as extra lives and items and any other icons you may want to use to represent in the metrics
- We're going to rebuild the `Metrics.tscn` scene so delete the one in the default folder

## 2. Create Metrics scene
- Create a new scene called `Metrics.tscn`
- 


## 3. Add Metrics
- Use the `DeafaultScene` or `Level1` and add `Metrics` to the `UI` scene
-
