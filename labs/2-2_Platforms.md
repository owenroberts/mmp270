This lab covers designing platforms to be used in a platformer style game.  The same process can be used for obstacles/walls in a RPG style game.  We'll creat the platforms in Piskel and use a TileMap in Godot to make collisions with the player and other moving objects.

## 1. Design the platforms
- Using Piskel or another art editor, create a set of repeatable tiles to use for platsorms
- First we'll make platforms for single tiles and one for a simple auto tile demonstration

## 2. Export sprite sheets
- Export our tiles as a sprite sheet

## 3. Create TileMaps in Godot
- Use a previous project and add the assets or download the [Artist Default](./Artist_Default.zip) folder
- Download [Assets Folder](./Assets.zip) if needed
- Create a new TileMap
- Add a TileSet
- Add tiles and set up regions, collisions and bitmasks
- Save TileSets to use in other projects

## 4. Documentation
- Post the tile sprite sheets on Open Lab
- Include screen shots of the tiles in Godot
