<div class="slide">
	<p>Emergence and progression are two aspects of creating systems for gameplay.</p>
	<p><em>Emergence</em> refers to the creation of very simple rules with open ended results.</p>
	<p><em>Progression</em> is an order of predefined challenges.</p>
	<p>Most video games use some aspects of both concepts in their design.</p>
</div>

	<h2>Emergence</h2>

	<p>Examples of emergence can be found in games like chess or <i>The Sims</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Simple rules combined into complex systems.</p>
	<p>Each gameplay will be different from previous games.</p>
	<p>Often hard to master.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Designers of emergent games study the effects of small changes to the structure of rules in the overall gameplay.</p>
	<p>Games of emergence will have a strategy guide rather than a walkthrough.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Typically playthroughs are short (there are exceptions, like <i>Civilization</i>).</p>
	<p>Emergent games are more likely to have an audience (chess, eSports).</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>Goals formed by individual players rather than being set by designers.</p>
	<p>For emergent games to be successful, the outcome must be greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">

	<p>The game designers can create "winning" conditions by accounting for likely results, for example, it is likely that players in <i>Monopoly</i> will go bankrupt, allowing other players to win.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Positive and negative feedback. Computer based emergent systems often include ways of handicapping the leader or winning player.</p>
	<p>Rubber-banding is an example of negative feedback. In <i>Mario Kart</i>, the players weapons aim forward to shoot the leading cars, but the speed of the cars also changes to make the game closer.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Challenges are built around interactions with other players. Usually require multiplayer or sophisticated AI that can immitate human actions.</p>
	<p>There can be desirable and undesirable effects of emergent gameplay. Undesirable effects are often exploitations of the rules for unintended advantages.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<h2>Rewards</h2>
	<p>Internal economies can be designed or emerge.</p>
	<p>Social rewards outside of the game.</p>
</div>

	<h2>Progression</h2>
	<img src="kingsquest.png">
	<p>Examples of progressive games include <i>Super Mario</i> and <i>King's Quest.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Levels or stages control the players progression through a game.</p>
	<p>The fiction of the game world is enhanced by progression.</p>
	<p>Narrative in game space is expressed spatially rather than temporarily.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Progressive games are reliant on video game platform distribution because they require lots of assets to build predefined levels and actions.</p>
	<p>Walkthroughs are created to show every part of the game.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Typically single player, can be multiplayer.</p>
	<p>Gameplay is usually expected to be longer, but usually only one playthrough.</p>
	<p>Typically easier to learn.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Using emergence and progression</h2>
	<p>Progression can be used as a way to introduce complex game systems in emergent games.</p>
	<p>Progress is often used as a resource for emergent games. Getting to advanced parts of the story can unlock new resources and abilities.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>These games should be designed so that the characters seems to have freedom but is likely to encounter the story or progression through regular gameplay. If the gameplay and progressive parts are not balanced the player can lose track of making
		progress or not learn the game mechanics correctly.</p>
