title: Representations of Race and Gender in Video Games
---

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">At least some of the absence of discussions of race in public and policy dialogues about video games can be attributed to the fact that the use of racially marked characters, themes, and environments, historically speaking, is a relatively recent development in video games. That is not to say that video games, even during the earliest periods of development, were necessarily race neutral but rather that efforts to build explicitly raced characters and worlds were limited by the styles of games being produced, screen resolution (4-, 8-, and 16-bit), and processing speeds.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">But while they are fighting to save virtual worlds, boldly drawn computer game characters of identifiable races are also raising sticky issues in the real world about the nature of racial identity. What sets some of these characters apart from those of previous video games is that their creators have tried to imbue them with "convincing," racially identifiable movements, personalities and vocal qualities. Black running backs in Sega Dreamcast's new NFL2K, for example, are more likely to prance and dance in the end zone than their white computerized counterparts.</p>

	<h2>Representations of race in video games</h2>
	<p>While some progress has been made in recent years, the history of representations of race in video games is full of racist stereotypes and tropes and inequitable representation.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">70-80 % of video game protagonists are white males.</p>
	<p class="quote">...Both studies found that while Black and Brown bodies are increasingly represented in current-gen videogaming, they are depicted using stereotypes of criminality, athleticism, or terroristic threat.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">Of the 1,716 characters identified in the study, 64 percent were male, 19 percent nonhuman, and 17 percent female.</p>
	<p class="quote">White males, for example, represented 52 percent of the male player-controlled characters compared to 37 percent for black males and 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively, for Latinos and Asians.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">For example, a systematic examination of game play from 150 video games revealed the following racial/ethnic character breakdown: 80% White, 11% Black, 5% Asian, 3% Latino, and 1% biracial characters. All minority groups, except for Asians, were underrepresented in the video game play in comparison to U.S. population figures.</p>
	<p class="quote">In addition, women and girls are likewise underrepresented, with minority female characters appearing least often in video game imagery.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">In a sample of 669 action, shooter, and role-playing games selected by EEDAR in 2012, 300 (45%) provided the option of playing as a female, but only 24 (4%) had an exclusively female protagonist. EEDAR found in 2010 that 10% of games had a protagonist with an indiscernible gender.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">According to Madeline Messer writing in The Washington Post in 2015, among the top 50 endless running games for mobile devices, 98% of those with gender-identifiable characters featured male protagonists, of which 90% were free to play. As many as 46% of these games offered female characters, and only 15% offered them for free. Playing as a girl required, on average, an additional purchase of $7.53, much more than the games themselves cost.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">For example, Dietz (1998) examined violence and gender stereotyping in her content analysis of 33 popular Nintendo and Sega Genesis videogames. She found that the most common portrayal for female characters was the complete absence of females. In fact, there were no female characters in more than 40 percent of the games that she sampled.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">The results revealed that of the 874 characters coded, 73 percent were male and 12 percent were female. When females did appear, they were likely to be seen in secondary roles. Dill and colleagues (2005) coded the role of each character encountered in their content analysis of 20 top-selling PC video games of 1999. The results revealed that across all 20 games, 70 percent of the primary characters were male and 10 percent were female. For secondary characters, 55 percent were male and 31 percent were female. Dill and colleagues (2005) also found that more than two-thirds of the main characters were white (68%), followed by Latino (15%) and black (8%).</p>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Representation among gamers</h2>
	<p>While representation in games has historically been dominated by white male characters, people who play video games and identify as gamers are much more diverse than you might expect given the common trope/stereotype of the white male gamer.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">A 2015 survey by Pew Research Center found that 53 percent of black adults play video games, 11 percent of whom are self-described "gamers." For white adults, these figures were 48 percent and 7 percent, respectively.</p>
	<p class="quote">Some 19% of Hispanics say the term “gamer” describes them well, compared with 11% of blacks and 7% of whites. </p>
	<p class="quote">Pew Research Center also asked about how minorities are depicted in video games. Roughly half (47%) of American adults say they are unsure of whether video games portray minority groups poorly. Interestingly, this is the most common response regardless of race or ethnicity.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">A 2008 Gallup poll indicated that men and women each make up half of all American video game players. In 2014 in the UK and in Spain, women comprised 52% and 48% of video game players respectively. According to a 2008 study by the Pew Research Center, "Fully 99% of boys and 94% of girls play videogames."</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">Among teens, 73% of African-Americans 13 and older report playing video games compared to 66% of the total population. A study done by ThinkNow Research reported that Hispanic gamers buy or rent games more than non-Hispanics. They also consider themselves to be ‘hardcore’ or ‘professional’ gamers compared to non-Hispanics.</p>
	<p class="quote">The following is a breakdown of gamers by group:</p>
	<ul class="quote">
		<li>Asian-Americans at 81%,</li>
		<li>African-Americans at 71%</li>
		<li>Non-Hispanic whites at 61%</li>
		<li>Hispanics at 55%. </li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">In terms of diversity of video game characters, a 2015 Nielsen study found that 65% of multicultural gamers felt that characters were not representative of their specific group, especially those that identified as Asian-American. In fact, nearly half of gamers think there is lack of racial representation in in video game characters.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">Many studies disprove the dominant White, heterosexual, male, teen gamer image. Indeed, this stereotype is consistently discredited, both popularly and academically.</p>
	<p class="quote">...based on interview data, that those invested in diversity in video games must focus their attention on the construction of the medium, and not the construction of the audience as such. This shift in academic attention is necessary to develop arguments for representation in games that do not rely on marking groups as specific kinds of gaming markets via identifiers like gender, race, and sexuality.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Representation among video game industry professionals</h2>
	<p>While we've seen the disparity between representation in video games and the gamers who play them, the disparity between gamers and the developers who create games is even more dramatic.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">The International Game Developers Association suggests that only 3 percent of game developers are African-American, a figure that has risen by only 0.5 percent in the past decade. In comparison, 76 percent of developers are white.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">...Rafael would be among the 2.5 percent of developers who are Hispanic, according to an International Game Developers Association survey of its membership.</p>
	<p class="quote">The same IGDA survey said its development community is 83 percent white. Blacks comprise 2 percent. Asians make up 7.5 percent, but in a sector with such a strong history across the Pacific, the issue of their representation is notably different from that of black and Latino characters.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Race and gender signifiers</h2>
	<p>So what does this all mean?  What does it mean for games to feature characters that disproportionately represent a specific race and gender, one which is overrepresented in the industry (white, male) and underrepresented both in the world and in the categories of self-identified gamers and people who play games?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">Videogames construct exotic fantasy worlds and peoples as places for White male protagonists to conquer, explore, exploit, and solve. Like their precursors in science fiction, fantasy, and horror, videogame narratives, activities, and players often draw from Western values of White masculinity, White privilege as bounded by conceptions of ‘‘other,’’ and relationships organized by coercion and domination.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">In their 2005 study, Karen E. Dill and K. P. Thill distinguish three major stereotypical depictions of women in gaming: (1) sexualized, (2) scantily clad, and (3) a vision of beauty. The study revealed that over 80% of women in video games represented one of these depictions. More than one quarter of female characters embodied all of the three stereotypical categories at once.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Discussion</h2>
	<p>While we have established that video games disproportionately center white male perspectives in their characters, many video games have either given the user the ability to customize the race and gender signifiers for their characters, while others choose non-white and/or non-male characters that the player must use.</p>
	<p>Which approach do you prefer?  Which approach will lead to more equity in representation overall?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Case studies</h2>
	<p>We've looked at some statistics on representation in games.  Let's look at some of the games these studies use to focus their examples of how representation works in games.</p>

	<p class="label">Duke Nukem 3D (1996)</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">Duke Nukem 3D presents us with a post‐apocalypse Los Angeles taken over by space aliens; the mission of the game is to save the white women whom the aliens target for “breeding.” At the same time, the only human characters present in the game are white; representing “interracial” L.A. as the territory of whites only, the aliens—in a strange act of substitution—become minorities and the ground of Duke's mission shifts from preventing inter‐species breeding to the threat of interracial miscegenation.  This is a far cry from the Los Angeles that Mike Davis refers to as a “poly‐ethnic, poly‐centered metropolis” and the city that Lisa Lowe describes as “nearing a time in which more than 50 percent of the population will be Asian, Latino, African American, and other ‘minority’ populations.”</p>

	<p class="quote">We intentionally mixed the nationalities [of Lo Wang], not out of ignorance, but because we knew it would generate mass amounts of flames [derogatory e‐mail] and e‐mail debates online. We just wanted to give people something to talk about. In the end Lo Wang is who you want him to be, and since “you” sort of become him in the game, we think it's good to have a fuzzy background, so you can assume his role more easily.</p>

	<p class="quote">But Colonization has a strict and problematic win condition: players must be a colonial power, must rebel against their motherland, and must fight in a war for independence. Instead of reaching terms of peace with the homeland, or paying the homeland for freedom, players are thus compelled to reenact the colonial history of the United States of America.</p>

	<p class="quote">Whiteness represents itself as a universal marker for being civilized and in doing so posits the Other within the language of pathology, fear, madness, and degeneration". Dyer (1997) contends that White identity is founded upon a paradox; that Whiteness entails both individuality and universality, while other races are limited to collateral objectivity. Dyer adds that control—over the self and the spirit, over women’s bodies, over land, and over others—is a hallmark of White identity. This is an important point for considering how videogames enact control as an integral part of the gaming experience.</p>

	<p class="quote">"Another difference with games is that, as a medium, they're about invoking our fears so that we can overcome them," Johnson speculates. "I think that's what happens in both Resident Evil 5 and also Dead Island. They're not just invoking fear of zombies, they are invoking fear of blackness, and offering the gamer an opportunity to challenge their racial fears as well as their other fears. What you're seeing here is a subconscious action. And the reason it becomes clear is because it's not in one game, it's in several different games."</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em> is a game that has received both praise and criticism for it's representation of race and gender.</p>
	<p>While it arguably employs racist stereotypes of people of color as violent, some critics argue it depicts people of color as fully developed characters. </p>
	<p>The GTA franchise has often served as a touch point for arguments about racist, sexist and violent content in games, and has been the center of several studies of representation in games.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">A different sort of game that reflects trauma experienced by Latinx people in modern-day America, Life Is Strange 2 addresses covert racism in a way that is, unfortunately, relatable for minorities in majority-white countries. Protagonists Sean and Daniel Diaz are discriminated against because they “don’t look like they’re from around here” and appear “dirty.” They’re treated as adults deserving prosecution, instead of as children in need of aid, in times where they get into trouble.</p>

	<p class="quote">Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed franchise has dealt with a number of historical settings, which it tries to capture in a manner that is realistic and respectful to the inhabitants of the real-world countries. The first game, Assassin’s Creed, features Altaïr ibn La’Ahad, a Muslim born in Syria during the uprising of the Nizari Isma’ilis, who is quickly adopted by their high-ranking members after his father dies. Altaïr’s story makes him a hero, as he rises in rank and then fails, and is given a chance to prove his worth as an assassin. It’s another story that doesn’t center his religion or ethnicity as the reason he’s in the game, he’s just a part of the world the game is set in.</p>

	<h2>Real world effects</h2>
	<p>Previously, we looked at representations of violence in games and the studies that attempted to show the relationship between depictions of violence in video games and real world violence or anti-social behavior.</p>
	<p>Studies have also been done to show the relationship between depictions of race and gender in games and their real world consequences.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">This study finds that players use their own experiences and knowledge to interpret [Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]—they do not passively receive the games' images and content. The meanings they produce about controversial subjects are situated in players' local practices, identities, and discourse models as they interact with the game's semiotic domain. The results suggest that scholars need to study players in naturalistic settings if they want to see what “effects” games are having on players.</p>

	<p class="quote">Robert Brookey (2007) expands upon this claim; in his analysis of gaming blogs, he discovered "overt racist attitudes" towards Chinese farmers; most importantly, that "some players, who harbor negative feelings toward Chinese farmers, do not believe that these feelings denote racial discrimination. Thus, though it is the case that players cannot see each others’ bodies while playing, specific forms of gamic labor, such as gold farming and selling, as well as specific styles of play have become racialized as Chinese, producing new forms of networked racism that are particularly easy for players to disavow.</p>

	<p class="quote">Thus, we ask a slightly different set of questions regarding video games as learning tools, namely, “Can video games facilitate learning that is anti-social?” Put another way, “Do the entertainment and interactive aspects of video gaming reproduce common-sense ideas about race and gender?” Ideas, that is, which can enliven long-standing and problematic notions of racial difference and deviance.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">The selling and marketing of urban culture is premised on notions of difference that, ultimately, reproduce rather than contest racial hierarchies. Discussing this very fact, S. Craig Watkins writes that “certain types of representations of blackness are more likely to be merchandised, not because they are necessarily real but rather because they fit neatly with the prevailing commonsense characterizations of black life.” Thus, hip-hop–oriented video games, like other hip-hop–oriented media, establish the ideas, values, and behavioral scripts that facilitate how young media users make sense of blackness.</p>

	<p class="quote">In the history of video games, LGBT content has been subject to changing rules and regulations, which are generally examples of heterosexism, in that heterosexuality is normalized, while homosexuality is subject to additional censorship or ridicule.

	<p class="quote">Some Japanese video games, for instance, originally included trans characters, such as Birdo from Super Mario Bros. 2, Poison from the Final Fight series, and Flea from Chrono Trigger.

	<p class="quote">In 2014, in a harassment campaign dubbed #GamerGate, numerous women in the gaming community known for being vocal about the toxicity within the industry were systematically targeted. One of the high-profile women that was targeted during Gamergate was Anita Sarkeesian—founder of Feminist Frequency, a web series (and later website) where Sarkeesian freely comments on gender, racial, and sexual identity inequalities in the media, including video games. </p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p class="quote">Other women who also experienced targeted harassment as a result of Gamergate were game developers/programmers Zoe Quinn and Brianna Wu, and actress and self-proclaimed gamer, Felicia Day. Most of the harassment involved rape threats, death threats, and the distribution of highly private and identifying information (i.e. home addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers), also called doxing. Faced with brutal online harassment, many women have felt forced to adopt strategies such as leaving game sessions, disguising their gender, or simply not playing games at all.</p>

		- Blood, Gore, Sex and Now: Race
		- By Michel Marriott - Oct. 21, 1999
		- But while they are fighting to save virtual worlds, boldly drawn computer game characters of identifiable races are also raising sticky issues in the real world about the nature of racial identity. What sets some of these characters apart from those of previous video games is that their creators have tried to imbue them with ''convincing,'' racially identifiable movements, personalities and vocal qualities. Black running backs in Sega Dreamcast's new NFL2K, for example, are more likely to prance and dance in the end zone than their white computerized counterparts. In the boxing game Ready 2 Rumble, Afro Thunder, one of more than a dozen boxers drawn in often crude racial and ethnic stereotypes, enters the ring with a James Brown-like scream before announcing, ''It's time to dance; it's time to dance, dance, sucker.''

		- Views on gaming differ by race, ethnicity
		- Some 19% of Hispanics say the term “gamer” describes them well, compared with 11% of blacks and 7% of whites. 
		- Pew Research Center also asked about how minorities are depicted in video games. Roughly half (47%) of American adults say they are unsure of whether video games portray minority groups poorly. Interestingly, this is the most common response regardless of race or ethnicity.

		- What Yellowface Hides
		- Shadow Warrior - sequel to duke nukem
		- Duke Nukem 3D presents us with a post‐apocalypse Los Angeles taken over by space aliens; the mission of the game is to save the white women whom the aliens target for “breeding.” At the same time, the only human characters present in the game are white; representing “interracial” L.A. as the territory of whites only, the aliens—in a strange act of substitution—become minorities and the ground of Duke's mission shifts from preventing inter‐species breeding to the threat of interracial miscegenation.  This is a far cry from the Los Angeles that Mike Davis refers to as a “poly‐ethnic, poly‐centered metropolis” and the city that Lisa Lowe describes as “nearing a time in which more than 50 percent of the population will be Asian, Latino, African American, and other ‘minority’ populations”

We just wanted to give people something to talk about. In the end Lo Wang is who you want him to be, and since “you” sort of become him in the game, we think it's good to have a fuzzy background, so you can assume his role more easily. (“Exclusive”)

		- ‘‘When Keeping it Real Goes Wrong’’: Resident Evil 5, Racial Representation, and Gamers
		- 2011
		-  This article examines gamers’ reactions to a developer’s use of Africans as enemies in a survival horror videogame, Resident Evil 5. Their reactions offer insight into how videogames represent Whiteness and White privilege within the social structure of ‘‘play.’’ Omi and Winant’s (1994) racial formation theory notes that race is formed through cultural representations of human bodies organized in social structures. Accordingly, depictions of race in electronic spaces rely upon media imagery and social interactions. Videogames construct exotic fantasy worlds and peoples as places for White male protagonists to conquer, explore, exploit, and solve. Like their precursors in science fiction, fantasy, and horror, videogame narratives, activities, and players often draw from Western values of White masculinity, White privilege as bounded by conceptions of ‘‘other,’’ and relationships organized by coercion and domination.
		- ‘‘Whiteness represents itself as a universal marker for being civilized and in doing so posits the Other within the language of pathology, fear, madness, and degeneration’’ (Giroux, 1996, p. 75). Dyer (1997) contends that White identity is founded upon a paradox; that Whiteness entails both individuality and universality, while other races are limited to collateral objectivity. Dyer adds that control—over the self and the spirit, over women’s bodies, over land, and over others—is a hallmark of White identity. This is an important point for considering how videogames enact control as an integral part of the gaming experience.
		- Everett, A., & Watkins, C. (2008). The power of play: The portrayal and performance of race in video games
		- 70-80 % of video game protagonists are white males
		- Both studies found that while Black and Brown bodies are increasingly represented in current-gen videogaming, they are depicted using stereotypes of criminality, athleticism, or terroristic threat. These characters
		- Early in RE5, the team sees a (extremely) White woman dragged screaming by an African into a second-story apartment. This scene evokes allusions of Black-on-White rape because of the woman’s Whiteness as well as historical connotations of Black desire for ‘‘pure’’ White women. There are no random choices in videogames; the developers chose that pairing to fit in with the horror aesthetic of the game.
		- There are no possibilities for nonconflictual exchanges between player and enemy.
		- This seems to be borne out by the 2007 E3 trailer, and indeed Sheva Alomar’s introduction appears to be a response to the outcry over the racial depictions in that cinematic.
		- Without any emotional, geographic, or linguistic connection to RE5’s rendition of Africa, Sheva is the videogame equivalent of Pocahontas: a woman of color coerced into ‘‘guiding’’ White explorers across a foreign land that she is presumed to be familiar with because of her ethnic heritage.
		- Leonard (2006) argues that the representation of Black bodies as violent caricatures in videogames reproduces fears of Black masculinity.

		- Modeling Indigenous Peoples: Unpacking Ideology in Sid Meier’s Colonization
		- 2013
		- As we became mired in the banality of logistical shuffling, we were struck with the ennui of the bureaucratic evil at the core of the game.
		- But Colonization has a strict and problematic win condition: players must be a colonial power, must rebel against their motherland, and must fight in a war for independence. Instead of reaching terms of peace with the homeland, or paying the homeland for freedom, players are thus compelled to reenact the colonial history of the United States of America. 
		- Many things would have to be changed in the game to make Native cultures fully playable in a way equal to that of the European cultures in the game.

		- Don’t Hate the Player, Hate the Game: The Racialization of Labor in World of Warcraft
		- Lisa Nakamura
		- 2009
		- As long as Asian ‘‘farmers’’ are figured as unwanted guest workers within the culture of MMOs, userproduced extensions of MMO-space like machinima will most likely continue to depict Asian culture as threatening to the beauty and desirability of shared virtual space in the World of Warcraft.
		- sort of orthagonal to representation in games, still interesting
		- Robert Brookey (2007) expands upon this claim; in his analysis of gaming blogs, he discovered ‘‘overt racist attitudes’’ towards Chinese farmers; most importantly, that ‘‘some players, who harbor negative feelings toward Chinese farmers, do not believe that these feelings denote racial discrimination.’’ Thus, though it is the case that players cannot see each others’ bodies while playing, specific forms of gamic labor, such as gold farming and selling, as well as specific styles of play have become racialized as Chinese, producing new forms of networked racism that are particularly easy for players to disavow.
		- A player who speaks either Chinese, ungrammatical or ‘‘broken’’ English, or refuses to speak at all, or who repetitively harvests the game’s prizes or ‘‘mobs’’ is often assumed to be a ‘‘Chinese gold farmer’’ and may be targeted for ill-treatment or even virtual death.

		- Do you identify as a gamer? Gender, race, sexuality, and gamer identity
		- 2011
		- This article concludes, based on interview data, that those invested in diversity in video games must focus their attention on the construction of the medium, and not the construction of the audience as such. This shift in academic attention is necessary to develop arguments for representation in games that do not rely on marking groups as specific kinds of gaming markets via identifiers like gender, race, and sexuality
		- Many studies disprove the dominant White, heterosexual, male, teen gamer image (e.g. Williams et al., 2008). Indeed, this stereotype is consistently discredited, both popularly and academically (Shaw, 2010).

		- The Video Game Industry's Problem With Racial Diversity
		- 2016
		- The International Game Developers Association suggests that only 3 percent of game developers are African-American, a figure that has risen by only 0.5 percent in the past decade. In comparison, 76 percent of developers are white.
		- A 2015 survey by Pew Research Center found that 53 percent of black adults play video games, 11 percent of whom are self-described "gamers." For white adults, these figures were 48 percent and 7 percent, respectively.

		- "Another difference with games is that, as a medium, they're about invoking our fears so that we can overcome them," Johnson speculates. "I think that's what happens in both Resident Evil 5 and also Dead Island. They're not just invoking fear of zombies, they are invoking fear of blackness, and offering the gamer an opportunity to challenge their racial fears as well as their other fears. What you're seeing here is a subconscious action. And the reason it becomes clear is because it's not in one game, it's in several different games."

		- The Power of Play: The Portrayal and Performance of Race in Video Games
		- Everett and Watkins
		- 2008
		- “‘When and where does the racial problematic enter in contemporary culture’s moral panics about gaming’s potential dangers?’ Society’s moral outrage over video game culture’s gender troubles (to borrow Judith Butler’s fecund phrase), especially its sexist and misogynistic constructs of women and girls, has not found a parallel in terms of race.” This leads us to ask, “What are the consequences of exposing youth to content that renders racist representations, beliefs, and attitudes playable and pleasurable?”
		- What games ultimately accomplish, according to both Prensky and Gee, is the creation of environments in which active (doing) rather than passive (telling) learning takes place. It is this aspect of video gaming—the act of doing—and its implication for both learning and performing race that we address here.
		-  Thus, we ask a slightly different set of questions regarding video games as learning tools, namely, “Can video games facilitate learning that is anti-social?” Put another way, “Do the entertainment and interactive aspects of video gaming reproduce common-sense ideas about race and gender?” Ideas, that is, which can enliven long-standing and problematic notions of racial difference and deviance.
		- At least some of the absence of discussions of race in public and policy dialogues about video games can be attributed to the fact that the use of racially marked characters, themes, and environments, historically speaking, is a relatively recent development in video games. That is not to say that video games, even during the earliest periods of development, were necessarily race neutral but rather that efforts to build explicitly raced characters and worlds were limited by the styles of games being produced, screen resolution (4-, 8-, and 16-bit), and processing speeds.
		-  In an examination of racial diversity in the top-selling console and computer games, an important study by the Children Now organization concluded that black and Latino characters were often restricted to athletic, violent, and victim roles, or rendered entirely invisible.12 Since that report, the state of race in games has, paradoxically, changed and stayed the same due, in part, to the rise of “urban/street” games. The arrival of this generic category has led to a discernible growth in the number of black and Latino-based characters and themes in some of the most heavily marketed games. But urban/ street games also reproduce many of the representational problems identified by Children Now.
		- White males, for example, represented 52 percent of the male player-controlled characters compared to 37 percent for black males and 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively, for Latinos and Asians.
		- The selling and marketing of urban culture is premised on notions of difference that, ultimately, reproduce rather than contest racial hierarchies. Discussing this very fact, S. Craig Watkins writes that “certain types of representations of blackness are more likely to be merchandised, not because they are necessarily real but rather because they fit neatly with the prevailing commonsense characterizations of black life.”20 Thus, hip-hop–oriented video games, like other hip-hop–oriented media, establish the ideas, values, and behavioral scripts that facilitate how young media users make sense of blackness.
		- Of the 1,716 characters identified in the study, 64 percent were male, 19 percent nonhuman, and 17 percent female.

		- 2020
		- A 2015 study showed that 83% of non-Hispanic Black teenagers play video games, compared to 71% of Caucasian teenagers, with 69% of Hispanic teens not too far behind. With the high percentage of teens of color playing games, representation is incredibly important but has — at least historically — been lacking.
		- A different sort of game that reflects trauma experienced by Latinx people in modern-day America, Life Is Strange 2 addresses covert racism in a way that is, unfortunately, relatable for minorities in majority-white countries. Protagonists Sean and Daniel Diaz are discriminated against because they “don’t look like they’re from around here” and appear “dirty.” They’re treated as adults deserving prosecution, instead of as children in need of aid, in times where they get into trouble.
		- Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed franchise has dealt with a number of historical settings, which it tries to capture in a manner that is realistic and respectful to the inhabitants of the real-world countries. The first game, Assassin’s Creed, features Altaïr ibn La’Ahad, a Muslim born in Syria during the uprising of the Nizari Isma’ilis, who is quickly adopted by their high-ranking members after his father dies. Altaïr’s story makes him a hero, as he rises in rank and then fails, and is given a chance to prove his worth as an assassin. It’s another story that doesn’t center his religion or ethnicity as the reason he’s in the game, he’s just a part of the world the game is set in.
		-  The International Game Developers Association found that 81% of developers identified as White/Caucasian and 2% identified as Black/African-American/African/Afro-Caribbean.

	Cultivating Virtual Stereotypes?: The Impact of Video Game Play on Racial/Ethnic Stereotypes
		- 2014
		- Results suggest that video game play cultivates real-world beliefs about Blacks, such that individuals who spend more time playing video games have less egalitarian views of Blacks.
		- For example, a systematic examination of game play from 150 video games revealed the following racial/ethnic character breakdown: 80% White, 11% Black, 5% Asian, 3% Latino, and 1% biracial characters (Williams et al., 2009). All minority groups, except for Asians, were underrepresented in the video game play in comparison to U.S. population figures. 
		- In addition, women and girls are likewise underrepresented (Burgess et al., 2011; Downs & Smith, 2009; Williams et  al., 2009), with minority female characters appearing least often in video game imagery (Behm-Morawitz, 2008; Burgess et al., 2011; Glaubke, Miller, Parker, & Espejo, 2001). 
		- Though minority characters appear infrequently in video game content, research suggests that mediated minority stereotypes are repetitive, memorable, and impactful on players’ real-world judgments.
		- The representations of racial and ethnic minorities typically rely on stereotypes, often of the young, deviant minority male (Behm-Morawitz, 2008; Burgess et al., 2011; Glaubke et al., 2001). These recurring stereotypes result in a stable set of characterizations of minorities that, though far less frequent than images of White male characters, paint a fairly consistent picture of the minority male for video game players. In general, video game characters are overrepresented as young, White men (Williams et al., 2009), Black male characters are likely to appear as athletes (Burgess et al., 2011; Glaubke, 2001) and criminals (Behm-Morawitz, 2008; Burgess et al., 2011; Glaubke, 2001), and Asians are disproportionately depicted as martial artists (e.g., swordfighters, ninjas; Behm-Morawitz, 2008; Glaubke et al., 2001). The more insidious criminal and villain representations of minorities are characterized by the depiction of the minority—typically the minority male—as sinister, unattractive, untrustworthy, violent, and having a lower work ethic (Behm-Morawitz, 2008; Burgess et al., 2011; Glaubke, 2001, Mastro & BehmMorawitz, 2005; Mastro et al., 2007).
		- The present study examines whether video game play cultivates White college students’ perceptions of minorities. The findings shed light on second-order cultivation from varied video game play and underscore the potential negative consequences of the limited and stereotypical representations of minorities in video games.

	and gender?
	
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_representation_in_video_games
			- A 2008 Gallup poll indicated that men and women each make up half of all American video game players.[1] In 2014 in the UK and in Spain, women comprised 52% and 48% of video game players respectively.[2] According to a 2008 study by the Pew Research Center, "Fully 99% of boys and 94% of girls play videogames."[3]
			- On average, female-led games sell fewer copies than male-led ones, but also have lower marketing budgets.
			- In a sample of 669 action, shooter, and role-playing games selected by EEDAR in 2012, 300 (45%) provided the option of playing as a female, but only 24 (4%) had an exclusively female protagonist. EEDAR found in 2010 that 10% of games had a protagonist with an indiscernible gender
			- According to Madeline Messer writing in The Washington Post in 2015, among the top 50 endless running games for mobile devices, 98% of those with gender-identifiable characters featured male protagonists, of which 90% were free to play. As many as 46% of these games offered female characters, and only 15% offered them for free. Playing as a girl required, on average, an additional purchase of $7.53, much more than the games themselves cost.
			- Female characters are often cast in the role of the damsel in distress, with their rescue being the objective of the game.[37][38] Princess Zelda in the early The Legend of Zelda series, the Sultan's daughter in Prince of Persia, and Princess Peach through much of the Mario series are paradigmatic examples. 
			- In their 2005 study, Karen E. Dill and K. P. Thill distinguish three major stereotypical depictions of women in gaming: (1) sexualized, (2) scantily clad, and (3) a vision of beauty. The study revealed that over 80% of women in video games represented one of these depictions. More than one quarter of female characters embodied all of the three stereotypical categories at once. 
			- However, a 2016 study of 571 games released between 1984 and 2014[54] found that the sexualization of female characters was at its height between 1990 and 2005, and then began to significantly decline.
			- In the history of video games, LGBT content has been subject to changing rules and regulations, which are generally examples of heterosexism, in that heterosexuality is normalized, while homosexuality is subject to additional censorship or ridicule. Companies Nintendo of America, Sega of America and Maxis policed the content of games with content codes in which LGBT themes were toned down or erased.[85][86][87][88] Some Japanese video games, for instance, originally included trans characters, such as Birdo from Super Mario Bros. 2, Poison from the Final Fight series, and Flea from Chrono Trigger. Due to adherence to Nintendo of America's quality standards and translations based on preserving gameplay rather than literal meaning, these characters' identities were altered or erased in translation.

		- 2019
		- Gender representation and equality is an issue that has been the focus of much inquiry and consideration in the gaming community. In an effort to investigate the presence of sexism in games, a study conducted by Indiana University analyzed in-game content of 571 games that were released between 1983 and 2014. The study found that the number of overly-sexualized female characters heightened in the mid-1990s, likely as a result of burgeoning technological advancements in 3D graphics. However, focused efforts to address and mitigate both: (1) the disproportionate underrepresentation of female characters and storylines in games, and (2) the misogyny women gamers encounter in gaming communities have been less prevalent. The industry’s failure to eradicate the prominent misogyny rampant in games and gaming communities has fostered an unwelcoming community for women.
		- A separate study conducted by Feminist Frequency discovered that of the games showcased during 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), only 3% of them had female protagonists while 41% had male protagonists. The implication here is that major developers continue to disproportionately construct male and female characters in game designs and narratives. Along with this disparity within the games themselves, there has also been a wide divergence between the percentage of women that are involved in the gaming community and the percentage of women that are employed within the industry. A survey conducted by the International Game Developers Association found that 22% of the workforce is female compared to 75% male despite the fact that women’s global market share of the gaming industry far exceeds 22%. The scarcity of women in the gaming industry workforce likely impacts the number of diverse portrayals of female game characters. 
		- In 2014, in a harassment campaign dubbed #GamerGate, numerous women in the gaming community known for being vocal about the toxicity within the industry were systematically targeted. One of the high-profile women that was targeted during Gamergate was Anita Sarkeesian—founder of Feminist Frequency, a web series (and later website) where Sarkeesian freely comments on gender, racial, and sexual identity inequalities in the media, including video games. Other women who also experienced targeted harassment as a result of Gamergate were game developers/programmers Zoe Quinn and Brianna Wu, and actress and self-proclaimed gamer, Felicia Day. Most of the harassment involved rape threats, death threats, and the distribution of highly private and identifying information (i.e. home addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers), also called doxing. Faced with brutal online harassment, many women have felt forced to adopt strategies such as leaving game sessions, disguising their gender, or simply not playing games at all.
		- Playgroundz, a video game data analytics and research platform, released the Leisure Economy Research Study which found that women are increasingly taking a larger share of the game marketplace with an estimated 49% of the share in 2018 and a projected market share of 50% in 2019.  Meanwhile, certain areas within the gaming industry do not reflect this near-equity of the market share between genders. For example, in esports and YouTube, women only make up 22% and 30% respectively. 
		-  Among teens, 73% of African-Americans 13 and older report playing video games compared to 66% of the total population. A study done by ThinkNow Research reported that Hispanic gamers buy or rent games more than non-Hispanics. They also consider themselves to be ‘hardcore’ or ‘professional’ gamers compared to non-Hispanics. 
		- In terms of diversity of video game characters, a 2015 Nielsen study found that 65% of multicultural gamers felt that characters were not representative of their specific group, especially those that identified as Asian-American. In fact, nearly half of gamers think there is lack of racial representation in in video game characters.
		- Asian-Americans at 81%,
		- African-Americans at 71%
		- Non-Hispanic whites at 61%
		- Hispanics at 55%. 

		vs developers
		- 68% identified as white/Caucasian/European,
		- 18% identified as East Asian, 
		- 5% identified as Hispanic/Latino,
		- 1% identified as African-American.

		Only 3% of non-white developers are in senior positions within video game roles compared to 23% of their white counterparts.

		- 2009
		- For example, Dietz (1998) examined violence and gender stereotyping in her content analysis of 33 popular Nintendo and Sega Genesis videogames. She found that the most common portrayal for female characters was the complete absence of females. In fact, there were no female characters in more than 40 percent of the games that she sampled
		- The results revealed that of the 874 characters coded, 73 percent were male and 12 percent were female. When females did appear, they were likely to be seen in secondary roles. Dill and colleagues (2005) coded the role of each character encountered in their content analysis of 20 top-selling PC video games of 1999. The results revealed that across all 20 games, 70 percent of the primary characters were male and 10 percent were female. For secondary characters, 55 percent were male and 31 percent were female. Dill and colleagues (2005) also found that more than two-thirds of the main characters were white (68%), followed by Latino (15%) and black (8%).
