<div class="slide">

	<p class="label"><i>Pac-Man</i>, 1980, Namco - 224 x 288 resolution, 16 colors</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>A good character performs two major functions in a game:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Gives the player an avatar to identify with in the game world</li>
		<li>Indicates some functionality of the character</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Pac-Man</h2>
	<p>Pac-Man is very simple but he's a brighter color than other characters and is easy to identify with.</p>  
	<p>Pac-Man has a large mouth so you know that he wants to eat things.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="mario.png" alt="">
	<p class="label"><i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, 1985, Nintendo Entertainment System - 256 x 240, 48 color</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>A unique identifying characteristic is also a good way to start with a character design.  Mario has several distinguishing features that make him a unique character, including his hat, overalls and mustache.</p> 
	<p>These visual traits don't tell us a lot about the functionality but create an sort of absurdity that tells us something about the game world.  Basically, it's fun.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<img src="battlezone.gif" alt="">
	<p class="label"><i>Battlezone</i>, 1980, Atari - Atari - Vector monitor (b&w) with color overlay</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">	
	<p>During the early days of video game development, the graphics systems and their limitations often played the main role in the aesthetics of games, including character design.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="canabalt.jpg" alt="">
	<p class="label"><i>Canabalt</i>, 2009, Multi-platform</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Of course, today there are virtually no limitations on the graphic quality of games, including the number of colors used, resolution of screens and size of images.</p>
	<p>However, many games still use pixel or vector based art to create a retro feel.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="limbo.jpg" alt="">
	<p class="label"><i>Limbo</i>, 2011, Multi-platform</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Even games with more data in graphics use simplified character designs or restrict the palette in order to create a certain mood or match a theme.  In <i>Limbo</i>, the character is a simple silhouette of a boy with two white eyes to show the face.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="isaac.jpg" alt="">
	<p class="label"><i>The Binding of Isaac</i>, 2011, Multi-platform</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Video games also borrow styles from sources like cartoons, comics, anime, film and other visual references.</p>  
	<p>Isaac is a very simple character with one specific mechanic, his tears.  This game mechanic reminds us of the origin story of the game and gives is a unique way to identify the character.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="mccloud.png" alt="">
	<p>Characters that are rendered with more detail tend to be interpreted more realistically.</p>
	<p>On the other hand simpler characters are easier to identify with for the player.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Choosing and aesthetic for your game (or combination of aesthetics) and designing a character can determine the feel of the game and give the user a sense of how the game works.  
	<p>Beyond the main character or avatar, design of enemies and other NPCs (non-player characters) should follow similar rules.</p>  
	<p>Their design should fit the aesthetic of the game world and give cues as to how they operate in that world.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The comic book artist Tato redesigned the characters from Overwatch in 2D and <a href="https://tomatatoro.tumblr.com/post/154791597753/character-design-tips" target="blank">wrote about the process</a>.  This is a good example of setting some basic rules for character design.  Your rules don't have to be the same but it's a good idea to try to come up with some basic rules after experimenting with different designs.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>It's important to make design an iterative process.  Iterative means repetition with added changes and reflection.  It's not enough to do one drawing and call it a day.  Designers will go through endless sketches and ideas before narrowing on a final idea.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Making game art</h2>
	<p>There's a lot of ways to make game art.  Today we're going to look at using Illustrator to make a character with vector art and the web application <a href="http://www.piskelapp.com/">Piskel</a> for pixel art.  Any aesthetic is acceptable for this project and other programs can be used as well.</p>
