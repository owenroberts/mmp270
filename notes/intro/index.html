<div class="slide">
	<h2>Interaction</h2>
	<p>Interactivity is the principal element defining games as a medium.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="input-feedback.png">
	<p>Interaction is created with input/output systems or cycles between the player 
and machine of feedback and response.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h3>A system of interaction in a video game</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>encourages exploration and understanding of the interface.</li>
		<li>encourages discovery and exploration within the game world.</li>
		<li>allows the user to master the tools of the game.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide no-reveal">
	<h2>Input</h2>

	<p>Gamepad</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Other types of input</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Voice or sound</li>
		<li>3d sensing - Kinect, Wii</li>
		<li>Arcade guns (light sensing)</li>
		<li>Other haptic sensors</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Output</h2>
	<img src="input-feedback.png">
	<ul>
		<li>Video</li>
		<li>Audio</li>
		<li>Haptic</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>A game uses feedback to communicate information to the player about the state of the game.</p>
	<p>The state of the game includes things like</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the level.</li>
		<li>the score.</li>
		<li>other metrics like health, speed or player status.</li>
		<li>information about other players in the game world, like location.</li>
		<li>information about other actors in the game world, like difficulty level.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Positive feedback</h2>
	<p>In order for players to understand how games are meant to be played, games must provide <note>positive feedback</note>.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Positive feedback is easy to understand and motivates the player to get better at the game.</p> 
	<p>Confusing or discouraging feedback is not positive.</p>
	</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="game-over.png" alt="">
	<p>Losing the game can be a form of positive feedback, if the reasons for losing are clear, and allow the player to develop their understanding of the game world and rules.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Game mechanics</h2>
	<p>Game mechanics are the system of rules that governs the way a user interacts with a game.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Game mechanics build up within in a game to create a complex world.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The interface allows the user to make actions.</li>
		<li>The game records the action and makes decisions based on the input and environment.</li>
		<li>Feedback in the form of changing game states is given to the user.</li>
		<li>The user interprets the feedback and adjusts their apporach.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This cycle continues until the game reaches its end.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Game dynamics</h2>
	<p>Game dynamics are the product of the game mechanics which determine the progress and experience of the game.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h3>In a game with good dynamics, </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>the rules of the game are easy to learn (not necessarily easy to master).</li>
		<li>the user is in direct control of the game avatar.</li>
		<li>players improve through gameplay.</li>
		<li>the game gives immediate feedback.</li>
		<li>the game gives sufficient feedback.</li>
		<li>the game allows recovery from mistakes.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Goals, obstacles and rewards</h2>
	<img src="goals.png" alt="">
	<p>Most games have established goals, whether they're specific, like saving the princess, or vague, like exploring an abandoned island.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Games use obstacles and rewards to lead the player toward goals and provide challenges to reaching those goals.</p>
	<p>The line between goal, obstacle and reward can often be blurred.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Complex games often have a variety of obstacles and rewards and multiple goals that are either sequenced or occurring contemporaneously.  These elements add up to make a complex game world with multiple possibilities.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>Goals can be objectives for the player to progress through a game or win the game.</p>  
	<p>Many games have one main goal and several side goals.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Goals can be compounded to create a complex series of events.  You may need to defeat several groups of enemies before reaching a level boss, and several level bosses before reaching the final boss of the game.</p>
	<p>Side goals may sometimes are unrelated to the main goal of the game.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Obstacles</h2>
	<p>Also referred to as challenges, obstacles are puzzles, enemies or other obstacles that prevent the player from achieving goals.</p>  
	<p>Sometimes challenges help lead player towards the goals.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Obstacles, like goals and rewards, are usually related to the game genre.</p>
	<p>In a puzzle based game you may have to solve math or logic based puzzles, either with limited or unlimited time.  In an arcade game, obstacles are usually enemies or barriers.</p>
	<p>In some games obstacles are more abstract, like locating items or characters, or deciding to choose different branches of a story.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Rewards</h2>
	<p>Rewards can take the form of currency, objects, visual rewards or other items given to the player for completing challenges or defeating obstacles.</p>
	<p>Rewards help tell the player that they are playing correctly and moving in the correct direction.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Rewards typically effect the game play, such as enhancing aspects of the player or revealing new parts of the game.</p>
	<p>Some rewards may be purely aesthetic and non-functional, like new graphics for the character.</p>
</div>
