title: User Testing
---

<div class="slide">
	<p>Throughout the semester we've discussed things like positive and negative feedback, progression and emergence, goals, rewards and obstacles and other aspects of designing game mechanics.</p>
	<p>Now it's time to put these principles in action and collect information based on a user's experience of our games.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>User testing is an essential aspect of game design.</p>
	<p>Unlike other artistic disciplines, interaction is an essential component of game design, so we can't call our games finished until we test how people interact with them.</p>
	<p>Games are meant to be played, so we need to understand what works and what doesn't to make sure our work is playable.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>What to test for</h2>
	<p>Getting good feedback from users depends on asking good questions.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Bugs vs Playability</p>
	<p>There is a difference between a game that is buggy and a game that works but is not playable.</p>
	<p>Ideally, our games will be bug free so users can focus on playability.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Onboarding/guidance</p>
	<p>Does the player understand the basic controls and movement?</p>
	<p>Does the player understand basic goals and game mechanics?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Play time</p>
	<p>How long does the player play?  Do they make it to the end?  Do they give up?  Why?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>It's good to have a goal in terms of the gameplay length.  A casual game might have a short play time, while a complex RPG could be played for dozens of hours.</p>
	<p>Does the player's play time match the expectation?  Why or why not?</p>
</div>

	<h2>Principles of testing</h2>
	<p>Expect your users to have little or no familiarity with gaming.</p>
	<p>Users have different levels of familiarity with gaming.  Don't assume a user is bad at gaming or doesn't undrestand something -- it's the game designer's job to make things clear.</p>
	<p>That doesn't mean the game has to be easy.  It has to be clear.</p>
	<p>Seek both qualitative and quantitative feedback.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Quantitative feedback</h2>
	<p>Quantitative feedback is anything that uses numbers or scales.  This is useful to see if there is general agreement among testers.</p>
	<p>This is good for aspects of the games that can be quantified or rated.</p>
	<p>Ask users to rate aspects of the game on a scale.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Qualitative feedback</h2>
	<p>Qualitative feedback involves verbal or written resopnses that go beyond a number or scale.</p>
	<p>This is useful to give users more space to describe their thoughts and capture reaction that the designer may not have considered.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Start by choosing the elements of the game that are most important to it's success.  If the game relies heavily on narrative, ask the users to rate the narrative experience.</p>
	<p>Choose a set of 5-10 things to ask questions about.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Frame your questions to get honest answers.  Instead of saying, "What was your favorite level?", ask "Which level did you like the most?"</p>
	<p>Include both specific and ambiguous questions to get a range of feedback, but avoid asking the user to invent a new game.  You don't want to ask what they would change or add to the game, you want feedback on the game you created.</p>
</div>

	<h2>User Testing Lab</h2>
	<p>In the lab this week we'll learn how to make a survey and collect responses.</p>
</div>

<!-- <div class="slide">
	<h2>Create a feedback form</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Use google forms to create a simple feedback form for you testers to fill out.  Don't overwhelm them with questions, it shouldn't take longer to fill out the form than it did to play the game.</li>
		<li>Include questions that have multiple choice or rating scales as well as written responses.</li>
		<li>Collect responses and then tally the results.  Notice if there are any trends or commons answers.</li>
