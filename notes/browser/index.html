	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>Browser games are games that can be played online.  Browser games are often free to play and are built on web technologies.  In 1996, <note>Macromedia Flash</note> was introduced as a plugin for web browsers that supported vector based animation and scripting with the programming language <note>ActionScript</note>.  This quickly led to the creation of many Flash games and websites that hosted them.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p>One of the first websites to host games was <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/" target="blank">Newgrounds</a>, which continues to publish and host games to this day.  It was originally created by Tom Fulp to combine two sites where he hosted his own games, including one of the first browser games, <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/seals/">Club a Seal</a>.</p>

	<p>Newgrounds became a popular website to publish and discuss games.  Many of these games were controversial and took on unconventional topics.  <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/59593?id=59593" target="blank">Alien Hominid</a> was another popular title by Fulp.  Another popular title was <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/463241?id=463241" target="blank">Meat Boy</a> which became a successful indie game as Super Meat Boy.</p>

	<h2>End of Flash</h2>
	<p>In 2007 the iPhone was released and it was announced that it would not support Flash.  A few years later, Adobe announced it would stop releasing new versions of Flash and would discontinue in 2020.</p>  
	<p>Although Flash continues to be a robust tool for creating games, new technologies were introduced in the 2010s, culminating with the release of HTML5 in 2014, which introduced graphics and audio support for HTML, JavaScript and CSS.</p>
