	<h2>Game setting vs World building</h2>
	<p>Although related, the setting of the game and the process of world building are different concepts.  World building refers to a general practice of inventing a fictional universe where a game or story takes place.  Creating the setting of the game is the process of thinking through all of the scenic elements of a game that gives the character a sense of the world the game exists in.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Your game's fictional world might be much larger in scope than the actual specific details of the game tell the user.</p>
	<p>The game setting must include enough details for the user to understand the basic premise and logic of a world.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Game setting vs Level design</h2>
	<p>Level design is another related topic that can be confused with game settings.  Level design is the design of the way a user moves through a level which involves the user interaction, the setting, the physics of the world, the obstacles and the rewards.</p>
	<p>Game setting is used to enhance level design but it is only one component of good level design.</p>
	<p>We'll cover level design more in depth in another class.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Types of game worlds</h2>
	<p>Before designing the setting for a game, the designer must choose the type of world the game takes place in.  Some options include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fantasy</li>
		<li>Perspective world (something about the characters perspective is changed)</li>
		<li>"Our world"</li>
		<li>Sci-fi</li>
		<li>Historical/period</li>
		<li>Mythological</li>
		<li>Fictional world (from an existing fiction like Star Trek or Blade Runner)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Let's see if we can think of a game that takes place in each of these worlds.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Physical dimensions</h2>
	<p>After choosing a type of world, the designer can begin to set specific physical dimensions for the game setting.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p><note>2d vs 3d</note> - In this course we are doing 2d games, but this is a important to take into consideration with the game design.  Some games work better in 2d than 3d and vice versa.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p><note>Boundaries</note> - In some games the boundaries are very clearly defined, such as <em>Tetris</em>, where we can easily see the playing space.  Other games do not show their boundaries and have to be explored to reveal the boundaries of the setting.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p><note>Scale</note> - In realistic games, like <em>The Sims</em>, the characters are scaled according to normal real world dimensions with buildings and other objects in the game.  In games set in a fantasy world, the scale of characters might be changed to reflect aspects of the game dynamics, such as a in <em>Katamari Damacy</em> where the unusual physics of the game allow the player to grow much larger than would be physically possibly in real life.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Game setting elements</h2>
	<p>This week we're focusing on scenic elements, so we'll ignore things like interactive objects and non-player characters.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Terrain</li>
		<li>Rules (natural rules like gravity)</li>
		<li>Flora / fauna</li>
		<li>Cultural artifacts</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Screen space</h2>
	<p>Because the screen is a 2d plane, there are different ways of dividing up the dimensions to imply dimensionality.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Background and foreground</li>
		<li>Vertical space</li>
		<li>Horizontal space</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Physical time</h2>
	<p>Another aspect of the game setting is physical time.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Does time behave like it does in the real world?</li>
		<li>Does it only move forward at a constant rate?</li>
		<li>Can the user control time?</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Finding inspiration</h2>
	<p>There are many places to look for inspiration for creating a balanced game world, in other video games, movies, art, every day scenes and other aesthetic practices.  Personally, I find things like aquariums and gardens inspiring for there use of space, cultural objects and balance of color and shape.</p>
